# Terms of Service for Marco: A Travel Companion

*Effective Date: 08-12-2024*

Welcome to Marco! We are excited to offer you a new way to explore cities – with a knowledgeable and tireless travel companion. Marco (“the App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) will tell you about the main locations of a city and answer all the questions you may have about them, or about the history and culture of the city you are visiting.

By using Marco, you (“the user”, “your”) confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with these Terms of Service (“Terms”), including any future updates. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms, you must refrain from using the App.

We may, at our discretion, update or modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be notified on the App, with the date of the most recent revision indicated at the top of this page. By continuing to use the App after the changes take effect, you agree to the updated Terms.

These Terms represent the complete agreement between you and the App regarding your access to and use of the App. Additionally, you may be bound by separate Terms and conditions when using Third-Party Services.

## 1. Access, Registration, and App Usage
a. Registration is not required for the initial use of the App. The user is provided with one free location credit, allowing the access any one of the free locations available.
b. To access additional locations beyond the free credit, the user must:
1. Purchase a pass to unlock the desired locations.
2. Register by signing up with Google or Apple account and agreeing to these Terms and the Privacy Policy.


## 2. Purchases and Refunds
a. The App provides two paid access options:
1. A one-day pass for EUR 7.99, which unlocks all locations for 24 hours and allows up to ten interactions with the LLM-guide per location during that period.
2. A three-day pass for EUR 14.99, which unlocks all locations for 72 hours and allows up to twenty interactions with the LLM-guide per location during that period.
b. Pass prices and features may change. Any changes will apply to new purchases only.
c. Purchases are processed through the App Store. Once the purchase is confirmed, you will gain access to the selected pass. Please note that we do not collect or store any payment details, as all transactions are handled directly by the App Store. For more information about information that we collect, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
d. If you are dissatisfied with the product, you may request a refund by emailing us within 72 hours of pass expiration. To request a refund, contact us at marcotravelcompanion@gmail.com with the email used for signing up, date of purchase, and reason for the refund request. Refunds are made through Apple’s refund system.
